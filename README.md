### Project Description
RedAlert is a community-driven app that connects women nearby to share period products during unexpected emergencies. It fosters quick support and solidarity, ensuring no one faces period challenges alone.

### The Solution
By turning "uh-oh" moments into "got-you-covered" moments! RedAlert creates a network of nearby women ready to share period products, making emergencies less stressful and more about connection and support. ðŸ’Œ
